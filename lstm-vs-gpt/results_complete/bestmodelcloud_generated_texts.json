PA AND LATERAL VIEWS OF THE CHEST: A large dilated, debris-filled, possibly fluid filled esophagus is again appreciated, abutting the right mediastinum, in this patient with known achalasia. The finding appears more prominent as compared to the right study of ___ but similar to ___. There is a questionable air-fluid level in the proximal thoracic esophagus. The possibility of progressed slowed emptying of the esophagus is raised. There is no evidence of aspiration. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The cardiac silhouette is difficult to assess.",
        "As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change. Extensive right pleural effusion, potentially combined with some degree of pleural thickening, relatively extensive atelectatic changes in the right lung bases. The extent of the ventilated lung parenchyma on the right is small and located around the right perihilar areas. Unremarkable left heart border, moderate tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. Normal appearance of the left lung without evidence of parenchymal changes or left pleural effusion.",
        "There is persistent opacification of the right lower lung field, likely due to known pleural effusion and atelectasis. Small left pleural effusion is again noted. Overall, there has been no significant interval change.

Minimal blunting of the posterior costophrenic angle may indicate a small right pleural effusion. Left lung is clear. Cardiomediastinal borders are unremarkable.",
        "As compared to the previous radiograph, a pigtail was introduced into the right pleural cavity. The major part of the pre-existing right pleural effusion appears to be drained. However, a new air inclusion in the right basal pleural space. This pleural air does not manifest as an apical pneumothorax. In fact, in the apical and lateral parts of the right hemithorax, there is still abundant fluid visualized. The volume of the right hemithorax, overall, has not increased. However, a short-term followup is required to assess for potential developing tension. Normally appearing lung parenchyma on the left. Unchanged left heart border and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.",
        "In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there is increasing indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels, consistent with worsening vascular congestion. Continued elevation of the right hemidiaphragmatic contour. It is unclear whether this represents a subpulmonic effusion or an intrinsic diaphragmatic abnormality or enlarged liver. Left lung is essentially unchanged except for worsening pulmonary vascular congestion.",

CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW: This is a redictation of a prior dictation that apparently did not go through. There is slightly rotated positioning. Compared with earlier the same day (___:___ p.m.), there is progression of opacification of the right lung, with only a small partially aerated portion of the lung seen in the upper zone. There may be some volume loss on the right, though this is difficult to confirm, due to rotation. The left lung is grossly clear, with resolution of previously seen left base opacity. No left-sided CHF, focal infiltrate, or effusion is identified at this time.Clips noted over lower mediastinum. IMPRESSION: Considerable interval increase in the degree of opacification of the right lung. This may represent a combination of pleural fluid and collapse and/or consolidation. Given the rapid change, is there reason to suspect mucous plugging? Findings discussed with the covering house officer, Dr. ___, at ~ ___:___ p.m. on the day of the exam (___, phone).",

Though the contour has the appearance of an elevated right hemidiaphragm, this appears to represent a large subpulmonic effusion when compared to ___ chest CT. There is improved aeration of the right lung with residual opacifications likely representing combination of atelectasis and known malignancy; cannot exclude superimposed infectious process. Atelectatic changes are noted within the left lower lung with a slightly greater degree of collapse in the posterior medial subsegment. Small left pleural effusion identified.

Bilateral lung volumes are low. Mild diffuse haze in both lungs could be mild pulmonary edema, but given the low lung volumes, its appearance and severity may be exaggerated. Prominent hilus and azygos distension suggest increased venous pressure. Bi-basal opacity is due to combination of small effusion and accompanying atelectasis.
